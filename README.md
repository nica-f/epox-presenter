Fork of tool to control Epox Presenter BT-PM01B

The Epox BT-PM01B is admittedly a pretty old presenter but I still own one
and it still worls like a charm with Linux - as long as you have this tool.
I kept it on my harddisk since almost 20 years now and for the sake of not
loosing it and of course also to keep it publicly available I put it here
now.

I have updated the autoconf files to work with a current Debian system
(Debain 9 as of now), the usual triple should work on most systems:

```
./configure
make
make install
```

Enjoy!
